## Introduction

This repository contains a Laravel project utilizing Laravel Sail for a smooth development experience using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: Laravel Sail utilizes Docker for its development environment. Make sure Docker is installed and running.
- **Git**: To clone the project repository from GitHub.
- **Composer**: Used for managing PHP dependencies (if not already included in the Sail container).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the Laravel Sail project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-laravel-sail-repo.git

Replace your-username and your-laravel-sail-repo with the appropriate GitHub username and repository name.

Step 2: Change Directory
Navigate into the project directory:
cd your-laravel-sail-repo


Step 4: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the Composer dependencies:

./vendor/bin/sail composer install

Step 5: Build the Docker Containers
Start the Sail environment and build the Docker containers:

./vendor/bin/sail up
This command will start all necessary services defined in the docker-compose.yml file, including PHP, MySQL, and any other services configured for your application.

Step 6: Generate the Application Key
While the containers are running, you may need to generate the application key for Laravel. Open another terminal window and run:

bash
Copy code
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
Step 7: Run Migrations (Optional)
If your project has migrations, run the following command to create the database schema:

./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
Step 8: Access the Application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access your Laravel application in your web browser at:
