## Introduction

This repository contains a Laravel project utilizing Laravel Sail for a smooth development experience using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your WINDOWS machine:
- **NOTE**: the .env file has been intentionaly uploaded for ease of setup so you don't need to create one anymore
- **Docker**: Laravel Sail utilizes Docker for its development environment. Make sure Docker is installed and running with wsl enabled to use wsl.
- **Git**: To clone the project repository from GitHub.
- **Composer**: Used for managing PHP dependencies (if not already included in the Sail container).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your WSL2 terminal and run the following command to clone the Laravel Sail project from GitHub:

```bash
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rmukaila/gameevents.git

or (for ssh)

git clone git@github.com:rmukaila/gameevents.git

Step 2: Change Directory
Navigate into the project directory:
cd your-laravel-sail-repo


Step 4: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the Composer dependencies:

./vendor/bin/sail composer install

Step 5: Build the Docker Containers
Start the Sail environment and build the Docker containers:

./vendor/bin/sail up
This command will start all necessary services defined in the docker-compose.yml file, .

Step 6: Generate the Application Key
While the containers are running, you may need to generate the application key for Laravel. Open another terminal window and run:

./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
Step 7: Run Migrations 
Run the following command to create the database schema:
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

Step 8: Access the Application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access your Laravel application in your web browser at:
http://localhost

Step 9: How to stop the containers
Once the containers are up and running, you can stop them with the following command:
./vendor/bin/sail down

Step 10: Run the queue job with this command
./vendor/bin/sail queue:work
This listens for any queued jobs and executes them. It's necessary since the application uses queues

Step 11: Access the Database GUI (Phpmyadmin)
When the containers are all app and running visit the phpmyadmin dasboard here:
localhost:8081

Username: sail
password: password
